Widely adopted in finance, healthcare,  insurance, and manufacturing, SAS  \nprioritizes data governance, auditability, and reproducibility, making it a standard in industries  \nrequiring rigorous analytics. Its comprehensive features cover techniques like regression, time series  \nforecasting, and survival analysis, while strong documentation and certification programs sustain its  \nrelevance in evolving technological landscapes.","outputs":[]},{"kind":2,"language":"sas","value":"/* Let's try to output the \"Hello World\" with sas to an external file */\n\n/*  The %let statement stores the path of the folder BIP_AI-Driven_service_innovation_summer_school_2025\n    in a sas macro variable we can use in this session to refer to the folder by using &BIPFolderPath.\n    In this example that is done in the file statement.\n*/\n\n%let BIPFolderPath=/workspaces/uat2_storage/BIP_AI-Driven_service_innovation_summer_school_2025;\n\ndata _null_;\n    file \"&BIPFolderPath./output/hello_world_output.txt\";\n    put \"Hello World\";\nrun;\n\n/* The only line we had to add was the instruction to write to an external file. */","outputs":[]},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"> When you run/execute the code cell displayed above the sas log will inform that:  \n> 1 record was written to the file in one of the NOTES.  \n> We can now verify that by navigating to the file in the explorer and opening it!   \n\n#### Let's look at some more code examples and practice\n\n##### Practice 5  \n\nWhat do you need to change in the code cell below to:\n1. direct the output to an html-file?

Doesn't it?\n\nYes, it does. At least to me it did. It always looks simple when you have an example or a template and  \nwhen you can use *copy-and-paste*! It was a bit different when I had to start from scratch with just  \nsome indications in writing. Nowadays with genAI it is easier. That is when genAI comes with a code  \nsample that works out-of-the-box. Unfortunately that isn't always the case. And when it isn't you need  \nsome coding skills to adapt the code and make it run!\n\n### Do you want to learn more about statistics?\n\n**Statistics You Need to Know for Machine Learning (21 hours e-Learning)**\n\nIn the course you learn how to:  \n* Explain the relevance of statistics in big data and machine learning.  \n* Relate statistical and data science terminology.  \n* Generate descriptive statistics and explore data with graphs.\n* Detect associations among variables.  \n* Perform linear regression for explanatory modeling.  \n* Compare explanatory modeling with predictive modeling.  \n* Describe the trade-off between bias and variance.  \n* Fit a logistic regression model for predictive modeling.  \n* Score new data.  \n* Explain the statistical foundations of machine learning.  \n* Discuss data difficulties and modeling issues and their statistical solutions.\n\n### Participants of this summer school can register for SAS Skill Builder for Students\n\nThe BIP Summer School 2025, focusing on AI-Driven Service Innovation, offers an engaging exploration of how  \nartificial intelligence shapes modern service systems.
